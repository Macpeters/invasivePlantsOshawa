      <h3>Dog Strangling Vine</h3>
      <p>
        This plant grows aggressively, twining around trees and plants in order to 'strangle' them
        out, leaving a monoculture of just dog strangling vine AKA swallow wort. it is not used
        as a food source by local wildlife, and so is allowed to run rampant.  Since it is related
        to milkweed, butterflies will mistakenly lay their eggs on it, only to have the larvae starve
        once hatched, since the vine isn't a viable food source.
      </p>
      <h4>Control</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Cutting before flowers can form</li>
        <li>Cutting the plant just above the soil to starve it out</li>
        <li>Pulling the young plant out by the root</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
