        Growing in dense patches along waterways, because it is an annual and grows quite tall, it shades
        out the area to prevent other plants from growing, then dies out in the winter, leading to soil
        erosion and destabalization of the bank, while preventing more deep rooted, native, perennial plants from growing.

      <ul>
        <li>Hand pulling before flowering to prevent seeding.  The roots are
          quite shallow, so they pull easily, and the seeds don't last long, so this
          may be one of the easiest to control, if the site can be access regularly
          for a couple of years.
