        Growing in dense patches along waterways, the shallow roots lead to soil erosion and destabalization of the bank,
        while preventing more deep rooted plants from growing.  The aggressive root system breaks through
        asphalt and concrete, and populations are extremely persistent, spreading through small pieces of vegetation or
        root, or via seed.
